## What is habito

Habito is a habit tracking system i am building for myself because i want full control about how it works.
My main motivation for habito is for it to be intrusive. I want to design a dedicated station that can be placed in your room so that your habits are always in sight and not hidden in an app or a notebook. For it to be accessible on the go and from anywhere it should also be accesible over the web. 

## Features i want

There are two types of tasks:
- repeated tasks
  - could be further seperated into habits (tasks that repeat often) and maintenance (tasks that repeat rarely - less than once a week maybe)
  - habits should show the completion rate in %
  - Option for task to always be there only once or for it to build a backlog or to disspear after the day
  - Options for repeat setting
    - Daily (including every n days)
    - Weekly (including certain days of week and every n weeks)
    - maybe yearly and monthly?
- One time tasks (or ToDos)
  - important to ba able to see the task relevancy
  - Task due date

Every task should have an estimated time to do.
  
Other ideas:
- insert a training plan with different workouts
- add projects as a sperate category
