## What is habito

Habito is a habit tracking system i am building for myself because i want full control about how it works.
My main motivation for habito is for it to be intrusive. I want to design a dedicated station that can be placed in your room so that your habits are always in sight and not hidden in an app or a notebook. For it to be accessible on the go and from anywhere it should also be accesible over the web.
